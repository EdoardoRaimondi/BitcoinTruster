# Title 
Analysis of bitcoin transactions trustability graph
# Motivations
Since OTC transactions are anonymously performed our aim is to investigate the transactions graph and give to it a proper formalism and interpretation, in order to enlarge its expression power.
# Methods
- node level : goodness and degree of nodes. Investigation
about a relationship between goodness of a node and the number of its transactions (eventually recalibration of the weights concordly) 
- graph level : find best goodness subgraph of size k ( eventually parallelize and/or approximated )
